#### this is a repo that creates a simplified REST API for adgstudios.co.za - to return Eskom Load Shedding Data or alternatively a PyPi Package.


<p>i realize that Eskom's RestAPI data does not have schedule data for all municipalities they have so much of money and they cant even provide data of that? that sucks i built this API in 1 hour. What is so hard to maintain this API? Is their RestAPI depreciated? I do not know it shows load shedding status of 5? When it is currently 4. That sucks i have to discard my other project or find a new way to get my loadshedding data. Anyway if they planning to revive this API. Your can use this package to do your queries in python or any other language. <br> Best Regards Ashlin Darius Govindasamy</p>
