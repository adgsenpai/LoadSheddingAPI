# LoadSheddingAPI

<img src="https://www.bloemfonteincourant.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Eskom-Logo.jpg" height="250px"> 

#### this a a repo that creates a simplified REST API for adgstudios.co.za - to return Eskom Load Shedding Data or alternatively a PyPi Package.

###### Why did i make this API?
<p>
  1. My computer runs 24/7 due to load shedding it messes that up! I got a UPS that gives me 15 minutes failover but i require my UPS to power my router for 3 hours. I need my computer to be off before the Load Shedding Time.
  <br>
  2. Maybe gonna design a cool web application to display the eskom loadshedding status with cookies etc?
  <br>
  3. Maybe better/Easier Rest API than Eskom???
</p>



###### On production, while under production feel free to view the documentation to help you on how to use the data that i am bootstrapping from.
